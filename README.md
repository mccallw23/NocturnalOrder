## Nocturnal Order
Is a Medieval RPG game developed in Unity. 


## Idea
The player spawns as a knight at the entrance to a Medieval village, who must find and eqip a sword laying on a pedestal before engaging in combat with a patrolling enemy Knight.  At any time, the player can choose to engage in a spontaneous display of dance by pressing "U".


## How to Play
You can Play the game by navigating to `MyDemoScene` in the project Assets folder and clicking the play button, or watch some gameplay by clicking the demo video linked below:

The game features NPC AI patrolling/agression logic, dancing and combat animations, health systems, Post Processing effects, Procedurally generated Swamp Terrain with vegetation, and performance optimization techniques such as LODs, Dynamic shadow resolution and reflection probes for realistic light interactions.

## Final note

This project marked my first attempt at using Unity and C# scripting to create a game.  The Open source nature of the project was made possible by the team at the DALI lab members who advised the use of git LFS.
